# Gificorn

This is a project done using ionic and angular.js. The goal was to utilize the Giphy API in order to search through a list of gifs, and also pull from a list of trending gifs.

Version 1: Achieved basic functionality with search and trending gifs.

Additions for Next Version: Enlarge images upon clicking them, and separate information into tabs.
